    longDesc: "At Visionary eye care, we believe in providing not just surgery, but a complete visual rejuvenation. Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgery in the world, and modern technology has turned it into a refractive procedure that can correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism simultaneously.\n\nWe offer a wide range of premium Intraocular Lenses (IOLs), including multifocal and extended depth-of-focus lenses, which can reduce or even eliminate your dependence on glasses for both distance and near vision. Our counseling team works with you to understand your lifestyle—whether you love reading, golfing, or driving at night—to select the perfect lens for your needs.",

In cataract surgery, the laser creates incisions and fragments the lens with perfect geometric precision, using less energy than traditional ultrasound. This means less trauma to the eye and faster visual recovery.\n\nIn refractive surgery like LASIK and SMILE, our robotic trackers follow your eye movements 1,000 times per second, ensuring the laser treatment is perfectly centered even if you move your eye involuntarily.",
